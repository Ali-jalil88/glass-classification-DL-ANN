# Glass-Classification-DL-ANN
### For Glass Classification using a Deep Learning Model (ANN), here’s a breakdown of the key topics:

###### 1- CSV Files & Data Splitting (pandas/sklearn):
- Load the dataset using pandas from a CSV file.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from the sklearn library.

###### 2- Data Preprocessing:
- Normalize the features using StandardScaler to standardize the input features for better convergence during training.

###### 3- Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
- A sequential model from Keras will be used to build the ANN with layers defined using Dense layers.
- Layers include input, hidden, and output layers, with activation functions such as ReLU (for hidden layers) and softmax (for multi-class classification).

###### 4- Optimizer (Adam):
- Adam is chosen as the optimizer, which is efficient for deep learning models, combining the advantages of both RMSProp and momentum.

###### 5- Loss Function:
- For multi-class classification, use categorical_crossentropy as the loss function.
###### 6- Metrics:
- Track performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Evaluation is done using the Keras model’s evaluate method.

###### 7- Epochs and Training:
- Train the model over a defined number of epochs, adjusting the batch size as needed.
- Use the training and validation data to observe how the model improves over epochs.

###### 8- Predictions:
- After training, make predictions on the test set using model.predict and evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
